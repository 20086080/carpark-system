# carpark-system
Carpark system consists of a car park, sensors, and displays to track the cars entering and exiting and the availability of parking bays.

The system uses displays to provide timely information about available parking bays as well as relevant information about weather and other messages such as Date and Time. The system is robust in allowing multiple displays for each Carpark.

The system uses entry and exit sensors to provide scanned car plates for vehicles entering and exiting the carpark. 

The following has been incorporated into the code 

•	The system tracks availability of bays in real-time

•	The system stores the scanned license plates of cars

•	The displays update promptly as cars enter or exit

•	The system is scalable for future enhancements

•	A process for logging all carpark activity such as entering and exiting of cars

•	The application includes unit tests and version management Git and GitHub
